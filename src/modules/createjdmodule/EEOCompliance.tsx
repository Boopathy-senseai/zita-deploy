          We are a federal contractor or subcontractor required by law to
          provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with
          disabilities. We are also required to measure our progress toward
          having at least 7% of our workforce be individuals with disabilities.
          To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a
          disability or have ever had a disability. Because a person may become
          disabled at any time, we ask all of our employees to update their
          information at least every five years.

        <Text style={{ marginTop: 8 }} align="justify">
          Identifying yourself as an individual with a disability is voluntary,
          and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer will be
          maintained confidentially and not be seen by selecting officials or
          anyone else involved in making personnel decisions. Completing the
          form will not negatively impact you in any way, regardless of whether
          you have self-identified in the past. For more information about this
